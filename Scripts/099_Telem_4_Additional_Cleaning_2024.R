# Now that we've removed a few bogus detections and calculated a rate in rkm/day,
# we can use those rates to filter out detections that suggest unrealistic movement rates.

# I did this manually since there weren't that many tags to look through, 
# but I'm sure it could be automated with a "while" loop where you:
#   1) Calculate distance, lag in days, and rates of movement between detections for each tag;
#   2) Remove the very first detection for each tag with an impossible rate (ex: movement of > 100 rkm at > 100 rkm/day);
#   3) Re-calculate distance, lag in days, and rates of movement between detections after first detection removed;
#   4) Remove next detection for each tag with an impossible rate;
#   5) Then keep doing those steps until no more detections are removed from any tags.
  
# Most of the obvious false detections with impossible movement rates are from the Morice Lake Outlet fixed (rkm 201) station in 2022. 
# This isn't surprising considering how noisy this station was (99% of dets removed during initial cleaning step).
# Seems to be lots of false detections at Morice lake outlet (83%) and lower bulkley (93%) station in 2023. 


# This step removes __ detections.
## Currently very messy but keep this adding to this
## this removes 9629 detections
